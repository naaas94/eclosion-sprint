# Professional Emergence – Public ML Sprint


From linguist to fully autonomous ML/NLP Engineer. This sprint documents that transition, from infrastructure to symbolic understanding.

Each project here targets a key capability: modular pipelines, embeddings, CI/CD, symbolic perception, or communication clarity.

| Project | Description | Type | Technologies | Repo |
|--------|-------------|------|--------------|------|
| `infra-starter-kit` | Setup base: Docker, structure, ML tooling | Infra | Python, Docker, Make, Poetry | TBD |
| `pcc-pipeline` | Privacy intent classifier with embeddings | ML Pipeline | BigQuery, Flyte, Scikit-learn, MiniLM | TBD |
| `embedding-mapper` | Embedding exploration and visualization | Symbolic NLP | SentenceTransformers, UMAP, Plotly | TBD |
| `mlops-template` | Reusable DAG + logging + schema validation | MLOps | Flyte, Pydantic, Hydra, CI/CD | TBD |
| `dl-symbolic-perception` | CLIP or CNN for multimodal understanding | Deep Learning | PyTorch, CLIP, torchvision | TBD |
| `public-portfolio-readme` | Entry point to my portfolio | Public Doc | Markdown, GitHub Pages | TBD |


I’m sharing updates weekly on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/alejandro-garay-338257243), both technical and reflective.

This repo is a **map of becoming**.
