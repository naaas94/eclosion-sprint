# eclosion-sprint

# Professional Emergence ‚Äì Public ML Sprint

From linguist to fully autonomous ML/NLP Engineer. This sprint documents that transition, from infrastructure to symbolic understanding.

## üö© **Strategic Pivot: Practical Projects First**

**After feedback from industry leaders and mentors, I'm prioritizing a set of practical, right-sized projects to complement my larger learning journey.**

These projects are designed to demonstrate hands-on ML engineering and MLOps skills, focusing on real-world, production-adjacent solutions. They are now the primary focus of eclosion-sprint v0.2.0:

| Project | Description | Type | Technologies | Repo |
|--------|-------------|------|--------------|------|
| `simple-model-api` | FastAPI service for serving a simple ML model, Dockerized, with CI/CD | ML Infra | FastAPI<br>Docker<br>GitHub Actions | TBD |
| `model-training-pipeline` | Configurable training pipeline with MLflow versioning and basic deployment | MLOps | MLflow<br>scikit-learn<br>Python | TBD |
| `data-pipeline` | Simple ETL/data validation pipeline for a public dataset | Data Eng | Pandas<br>Great Expectations<br>Python | TBD |

**These projects are being built and released first to provide clear, focused proof points of my ability to deliver practical ML solutions.**

## üß≠ **Long-Term Vision: Research & Symbolic Reasoning**

The original eclosion-sprint roadmap (see below) remains active, but advanced/research projects (like `embedding-mapper`, `dl-symbolic-perception`, and the RAG-based `AI-You` assistant) will follow after these foundational projects are shipped.

This sequencing ensures my portfolio demonstrates both practical engineering and my growth toward advanced NLP and symbolic reasoning.

## üó∫Ô∏è **Project Map (Full Journey)**

Each project here targets a key capability: modular pipelines, embeddings, CI/CD, symbolic perception, or communication clarity.

I‚Äôm sharing updates weekly on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/alejandro-garay-338257243), both technical and reflective.

This repo is a **map of becoming**.
A living index of work in motion, not a finished portfolio.
