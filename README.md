# eclosion-sprint

# Professional Emergence – Public ML Sprint

From linguist to fully autonomous ML/NLP Engineer. This sprint documents that transition, from infrastructure to symbolic understanding.

## 🚩 **Strategic Pivot: Practical Projects First**

**After feedback from industry leaders and mentors, I'm prioritizing a set of practical, right-sized projects to complement my larger learning journey.**

These projects are designed to demonstrate hands-on ML engineering and MLOps skills, focusing on real-world, production-adjacent solutions. They are now the primary focus of eclosion-sprint v0.2.0:

| Project | Description | Type | Technologies | Status | Repo |
|--------|-------------|------|--------------|--------|------|
| `simple-model-api` | FastAPI service for serving a simple ML model, Dockerized, with CI/CD | ML Infra | FastAPI<br>Docker<br>GitHub Actions | 🟡 In Progress | [Repo](https://github.com/naaas94/simple-model-api) |
| `model-training-pipeline` | Configurable training pipeline with MLflow versioning and basic deployment | MLOps | MLflow<br>scikit-learn<br>Python | 🔴 In Queue | TBD |
| `data-pipeline` | Simple ETL/data validation pipeline for a public dataset | Data Eng | Pandas<br>Great Expectations<br>Python | 🔴 In Queue | TBD |

**These projects are being built and released first to provide clear, focused proof points of my ability to deliver practical ML solutions.**

## 🧭 **Long-Term Vision: Research & Symbolic Reasoning**

The original eclosion-sprint roadmap (see below) remains active, but advanced/research projects (like `embedding-mapper`, `dl-symbolic-perception`, and the RAG-based `AI-You` assistant) will follow after these foundational projects are shipped.

This sequencing ensures my portfolio demonstrates both practical engineering and my growth toward advanced NLP and symbolic reasoning.

I'm sharing updates weekly on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/alejandro-garay-338257243), both technical and reflective.

This repo is a **map of becoming**.
A living index of work in motion, not a finished portfolio.
